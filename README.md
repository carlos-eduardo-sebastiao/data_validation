# Data Vallidation

The data validation project aims to validate a user's data, such as CPF, CNPJ, telephone data, and also make use of an api (ViaCEP) to, through the user's zip code, find street, neighborhood and state.
With the data entered, at the end of the project I wanted to present the data as a form of registration.


## 📋 Prerequisites

What will you need to compile the project on your machine?

```
-- Python 3
-- Some python code editor such as: Pycharm, Numpy or Visual Studio Code
```


### 🔧 Installation

To install python 3 or some code editor on your machine is very simple.
There are videos on the YouTube platform, tutorials on the internet and on the website of the tool itself there is documentation and step by step.


## ⚙️ Running the tests

To test the project:
 Once the tools are downloaded and configured, you can run the code.
At the end of the information provided by the user, the system will return all the data necessary to perform a registration simulation.

```
As with all projects, because this is my first in python, I recommend that you carry out the tests to understand the code.
```


## 📦 Development

When developing the project, I was able to learn many concepts and put into practice all the theory I knew about the language.
No framework was used and all methods used are provided by python 3 itself.
Using the validate_docbr import was one of the most interesting, because it allowed me to know methods to validate data in the standard of my native language.


## 🛠️ Built with

## 🎁 Space for thanks

* I thank the Alura and FIAP platforms for all the theoretical knowledge I obtained in the courses taken.
* If you're around, I hope you'll review and contribute my code if you think it could improve. I'm always open to learn. 😊
